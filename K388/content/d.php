		<li>Qualifying Properties</li>
		<br>
		<p>The exchange only works for investment real estate or business properties. An investment property is one that is purchased in order to lease and derive income. Business property is one owned and used by a business and is held on the balance sheet as an asset. All real properties, whether improved or unimproved, are generally of like kind. It applies on exchanges of inventory, stocks, bonds, notes, other securities or personal property of any kind.</p>
		<br><br>
		<li>Timing</li>
		<br>
		<p>While transactions need not be simultaneous, there are restrictions on certain transaction timing elements. In order to qualify a transaction as an exchange, an investor must identify the property to be exchanged before closing and identify the replacement property within days of closing the sale of the first asset. In addition the transaction to acquire the replacement property must be executed within days of executing the sale of the first deal. For most investors one of the most difficult tasks is identifying replacement assets within 45 days of selling the relinquished asset. Yet it is important that they do so because these timing restrictions are very stringent, and the IRS does not grant extensions.</p>
		<br><br>
		<li>Qualified Intermediary</li>
		<br>
		<p>The complexity of these arrangements and the requirements and restrictions surrounding the exchange, the investors sponsoring the exchange must use a qualified intermediary to facilitate the deal. The qualified intermediary, defined as a corporation that is in the full-time business of facilitating exchanges, does not provide legal or tax advice. It cannot be a business party, such as a real estate agent that has had any relationship with the taxable party within months prior to the first property transaction. Preferably the QI should be a third-party business that has not previously provided any of these services to any transaction participants.</p>
